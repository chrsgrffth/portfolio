      Octopus designed CoverHound's initial product that went on to be wildly successful. After a few years, CoverHound wanted to update their interface with a more up-to-date aesthetic and support for mobile devices. My first part of my role was to design the interactions and interface of the mobile bind and insurance compare flows. I then wrote the front-end code for the designs that would be integrated with their back-end infrastructure.

      ## Utilizing Touch Gestures

      What mobile devices might lack in space is made up for with the ability to use touch gestures. A request to compare insurances can include multiple vehicles and multiple drivers. Laying out this content in a linear, page-to-page way would create a process easily to get lost in. We wanted to keep the flow down to four pages – a page for each step. To do this, we group represented vehicles and drivers with tiles on their respective screens. These tiles can be scrolled up or down to view or enter information and they can be dragged left and right to switch to a different vehicle or driver.

      ## Getting the Most out of Insurance

      One of CoverHound's goals with this project was to help their customers get the best insurance for the lowest price. To do this, we designed this mobile process to be easily "walked through" with a fixed banner to provide information about the focused input.
