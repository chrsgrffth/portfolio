      After the initial planning of the business and application, the founders of Spera were ready to start marketing their vision. They came to me with wireframes of their product. I consulted on both user experience and interaction decisions and designed the visual aesthetic for their platform, delivering assets that are used to both inform the development of the product and steer attention its direction. To finalize the project, I delivered screen designs and a styleguide that document the elements and design specifications that can be used by Spera's team to iterate expand upon the product.

      ## Key Pages

      At the center of the alumni's experience are the home and activity feed. The home page provides an overview of tasks and notifications for the individual, while the feed provides an overview of the activity in an alumni's network.

      ## Resource Pages
      The first objective of this project was to identify a visual direction for the platform. The direction would inform the design of further screens and components in the design system. Spera's founders wanted the platform to feel light-hearted and professional.

      ## A Cohesive System
      Design systems play an important role in any digital interface and for Spera this was no different. The pattern library and styleguide will communicate the meaning of visual styles to both developers and designers who are added to the team and will continue to build upon the system I've created.
