overview: |
  Advertising revenue is a driving force on the internet. There are hundreds of advertising networks that websites use to earn income, but with that comes a mess of accounts, emails, spreadsheets, and forgotten passwords. Adterminal recognized this issue and built an application that integrates advertising networks into one system so companies can see a clearer picture of their revenue.
