overview: |
  Design Kollective is giving a voice back to the "mom and pop" furniture boutiques who have seen a decline in traffic through their stores as more convenient – but less unique – options have dominated the market online. On Design Kollective, boutiques create storefronts where their products are discoverable not just by local customers but eager customers around the country.
