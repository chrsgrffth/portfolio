overview: |
  Design Kollective is giving a voice back to the "mom and pop" furniture boutiques who have seen a decline in traffic through their stores as more convenient – but less unique – options have dominated the market online. On Design Kollective, boutiques create storefronts where their products are discoverable not just by local customers but eager customers around the country.

      My role on the team at Octopus was to design and build the marketing website that would collect e-mails of interested boutiques while we built the product. With the interim site up, I planned and designed the interactions and interface of the application and wrote the front-end code alongside the programming of the API.

      ## Shopping

      The main attraction of Design Kollective for consumers is the ability to explore unique furniture online. To facilitate this "exploration", the heart of the web application's experience is searching. To reduce the amount of thought or decision-making required to initiate a search, the focused state of the search input displays an overlay with the most popular tags of each category – room, furniture category, color, store location, and material. It also provides the recent searches as a way to return to previous shopping sessions.

      ## Cart and Checkout

      In design, we put the focus on the individual components that would make up pages as opposed to the pages themselves. Our goal was to make components recognizable not only by images and content, but by characteristics such as layout and scale. Other components include page tiles, user tiles, and collection tiles. In the code, this methodology allowed us to create self-sustaining components that can be used in a number of contexts with key functionality always available to them.

      ## Boutique Onboarding

      The most important functionality on the flip side of the consumer, is the onboarding of the boutiques. Because Design Kollective will rely on the boutiques to fill the platform with content, we needed to create an onboarding experience that was as simple as possible.

      To start, Design Kollective will provide the boutiques of their choosing with uniques URL's that will let the application know the requesting user is a verified shop owner. After creating an account on Design Kollective, they will be redirected to the boutique onboarding where they will be able to create their online storefront, upload their inventory, add a bank account, and launch their first flash sale.

      ## Boutique Administration

      Once onboarding has been completed, boutique owners will have access to the full suite of features. With the dashboard, they are able to view and act upon transaction, manage more sales, manage their inventory, and edit the look of their store page.

      ## Marketing Website

      Before we could actively design and develop Design Kollective, we had to create a marketing site that could be used as a tool to generate interest and collect the emails of interested boutiques.
